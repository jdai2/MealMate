# MealMate - hackathon-10

This is our group project that we embacked for hackathon-10. The goal is to create a solution using smart glasses to do real-life scanning and provide information on the glasses. 

Due to the limited time, we managed to create two models that recognise groceries items and numbers (as well as converting the currency to the user's specification).

- `ImageRecognition.py` was trained on model with with images of apples, oranges and bananas. 
- `OCR.py` was trained on alphanumeric values, but was modified to identify and output numbers.
